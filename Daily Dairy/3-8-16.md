Focus of today was writing random generators in Scala using existing generators of scalaCheck.

A example of generating random trees:

```scala

abstract class Tree
case class Node(x:Int,left: Tree, right:Tree) extends Tree
object Leaf extends Tree
```
We can write a leaf geneator this way: (I don't really understand it much but what I get is a Generator of type: `Gen[Leaf.type]`
```scala
val emptyGen = const(Leaf)
```
Next we can write a generator for NonEmpty Tree or a Node of a tree recursively in this manner:

```scala
val nonEmptyGen = for {
  x <- Arbitrary.arbitrary[Int]
  left <- genTree
  right <- genTree
} yield Node(x,left,right)
```
The important thing is the usage of `Arbitrary.arbitrary[T]`. This gives back a generator of `type T`.
We can get samples or random instances of `type T` by typing `Arbitrary.arbitrary[T].sample`. 
We can define `genTree` using `oneOf` (`oneOf` takes any number of generators):

```scala
def genTree: Gen[Tree] = oneOf(emptyTree, nonEmptyTree)
```
An example of generated Tree: ( In Scala workSheet)

```scala
res2: Option[Tree] = Some(Node(0,Node(-218885487,Leaf,Leaf),Leaf))
```
Interestingly I had to write a random Generator for heaps, precisely binomial heaps. I kept worrying about how I can generate
individual binomial trees and then combine them in the order of ranks but saw a very nice implementation, smart work I could say,
in the discussion forums and it helped me come up with this. The idea was to generate random integers and assuming I have random
heaps with me, just combine the random heap with the integer using `insert` method. 
It can be done as follows: 
```scala
val emptyHeap = const(empty)
val nonEmptyHeap = for {
    x <- Arbitrary.arbitrary[A]
    heap <- genHeap
  } yield insert(x,heap)
lazy val genHeap: Gen[H] = oneOf(emptyHeap,nonEmptyHeap)
implicit lazy val arbHeap: Arbitrary[H] = Arbitrary(genHeap)
```
The last line, I just know that that's how you write it :)
An example of arbitrary heaps:

```scala
res3: Option[H] = Some(List(Node(0,0,List())))
```
`H` is an alias for the type of Heap.
This was all for today.
Final comment: Generators in scalaCheck are deceivingly simple.
