**Today: Just scratched the surface of Funtional Rective Programming.**

Imperative Reactive Programming concepts:
We have something called **Models** and **Views**. **Models** can `Subscribe` to **Views** and we called such **Models** as 
`Publisher`.

Overall the template looks somthing like this:
```scala

trait Publisher	{
	private var subscribers: Set[Subscriber] = Set()

	def subscribe(subscriber:Subscriber) = subscribers += subscriber

	def unSubscribe(subscriber: Subscriber) = subscribers -= subscriber

	def publish():Unit = subscribers.foreach(_.handler(this))
}

trait Subscriber {
	def handler(publisher: Publisher)
}
```
So the explanation goes this way, all the `subscribers` contain a method called `handler`. This method is called everytime via the 
method `publish` something of a `Publisher` changes. For Ex. When a deposit is made or some money in withdrawn from the bank 
account, the bank account holder can be seen as a `Publisher` and someone like `Consolidator` can be seen as a `Subscriber` where he 
keeps track of sum of the balances of different bank accounts. Every action of deposit and withdraw fires the `publish` method which in 
turn fires the `handler` of each `Subscriber` in the list `subscribers`.

But this is an Imperative way of Reactive Programming where we handle events using `var`s!
