# The-Scala-Way

**A repository to keep track of progress of learning Scala and FP.**

*Contains the following things :*
- Coded Assignments
- 10 line summary of newly learnt things in FP as and when I learn it. (A sort of daily dairy)
- Some study material that can be quicky referred to like Reserach Papers, links to specific things, etc.
