# My-FP

**A repository to keep track of progress of learning FP.**

**Contains the following things : **
- Coded Assignments
- 10 line summary of newly learnt things in FP as and when I learn it. (A sort of daily dairy)
- Some study material that can be quicky referred to like Reserach Papers, links to specific things, etc.
